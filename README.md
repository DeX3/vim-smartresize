SmartResize for VIM
===================

tmux-like resizing for vim splits.

Per default, the resize-functionality for vim splits is nice but not very
intuitive. `tmux` does a better job by providing a more logical approach to
pane resizing. This plugin enables the same functionality for vim splits.
