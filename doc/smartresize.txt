Per default, the resize-functionality for vim splits is nice but not very
intuitive. `tmux` does a better job by providing a more logical approach to
pane resizing. This plugin enables the same functionality for vim splits.

Instead resize-commands to resize the current window, smartresize's commands
move the split the current window is adjacent to.

This plugin works best combined with plugins like vim-submode.
